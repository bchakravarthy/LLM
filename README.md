# Landlord Mobile

Today, landlords are overwhelmed with the amount of information they have to deal with - information about properties, taxes, expenses, tenants & their backgrounds to name a few.  Worse, keeping track of receipts and association with properties can be time-consuming.  

Come year end tax season, this can further aggravate the situation adding further to the frustration. We want to promote the concept of self-service property management by way of mobile-enabled application, allowing landlords to focus on investments rather than managing clutter of paper documents.

Originating as a web app, Landlord Mobile was designed as a concept of self-service property management by way of mobile-enabled application, allowing landlords to focus on investments rather than managing clutter of paper documents. We have implemented an iPhone mobile application to solve the problem. Since more and more users are using cell phone intensively, our Landlord Mobile iOS app would assist them to manage properties via their mobile devices without requiring a computer.
